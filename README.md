# Highridge Construction Company Payment Slips 
We build a Python program to facilitate the weekly payments of workers at Highridge construction company.
This program helps in automating the payment process by generating payslips for the workers.

# How the program works
Dynamically creates a list of workers (at least 400 workers).
Utilizes a for loop to generate payment slips for each of the 400 workers.
Has an exception handling to address potential errors.

### Libraries required
R6 for use in R
No libraries required for Python

# Project Workflow
